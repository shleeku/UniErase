# Notes:  
# 1. If sae_path is set, the model loads locally, and release/sae_id can be omitted.  
# 2. If sae_path is empty, release and sae_id must be provided for remote loading.  
# 3. For feature queries or descriptions, release and sae_id are always required, even if sae_path is set.  
# 4. If all three parameters are set, ensure they match (see /hparams/Steer/sae_feature_hparams/pretrained_saes.yaml).
